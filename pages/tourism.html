        <h3><em>Faith Tourism</em></h3>
        <p>Izmir, which has hosted important civilizations throughout history, is one of the important cities of our country in terms of faith tourism as the place of religions and the lands where people with different beliefs live together.
            Within the scope of Faith Tourism , which can be defined as the evaluation of the visit of holy places to tourists belonging to other religions within the context of tourism, the three major religions known as Celestial Religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism), which are known as Faith Tourism , have attracted a great interest from tourists. Izmir is a faith tourism destination where religious worship is carried out freely for centuries and the people of the country live together in full freedom of faith and brotherhood.
            Within this scope, our city has a very special position with its values. The House of Virgin Mary, which is very important for Christians and declared as a place of pilgrimage, is the first church built in the name of the Virgin Mary. Jesus' favorite disciple St. John's The Basilica of St. John, the Seven Sleepers Cave and three of the seven churches built in Anatolia to spread Christianity were Smyrna (İzmir), Ephesus (Selçuk) and Pergamon (Bergama) - (others Sardis (Sart), Thyatira (Akhisar), Philadelphia (Alaşehir) and Laodicea (Denizli)) - Being in İzmir makes our city an important attraction center in terms of faith tourism.

        <h3><em>Sea Tourism</em></h3>
        <p>The influence of the sea - sun - sand trio continues among the current types of tourism. Sea tourism or coastal tourism is one of the most in-demand types of tourism in Izmir. Izmir is very suitable for this type of tourism with its long coasts, clean sea, and beaches, Blue Flag beaches, natural and historical beauties, as well as the perfect climate which are effective in creating a great experience of sea tourism.

            İzmir has a coastline of 629 km in the Aegean Sea and 101 km of it includes completely natural beaches that are used for sea tourism. The beaches of Selçuk-Pamucak, Urla and Güzelbahçe, Çesme-Ilıca and Altınkum, Gümüldür and Özdere and the beaches of Dikili and Çandarlı, Foça - Yeni Foça on the northern side stand out in terms of their favorable beach conditions. Transportation to the beaches is extremely easy. Transportation is available at every hour to almost every district from Izmir central terminal and Üçkuyular terminal.
            
            Aside from the sea-sand-sun trio, the vehicles are used effectively for yacht tourism, excursion boat tours, water sports for tourism purposes, and many other activities.
            
            The prominent place in terms of water sports in İzmir is the Alaçatı District, which is a perfect destination for windsurfing. 10 minutes from Çeşme, Alaçatı is one of the best windsurfing locations in the world and hosts international organizations as well. It can be expected that Alaçatı, which has been a popular destination for tourism in recent years, will continue to be a popular tourism spot.
            
            Other prominent coastal districts in terms of water sports for tourism purposes are Menderes, Seferihisar, Karaburun, Foça, Dikili, and Selçuk. In these destinations, underwater and surface water sports are organized through agencies, facilities, and sea tourism agencies.
            
            In addition, since İzmir is a border town and the Greek islands are only a short distance away and there are regular ferry tours in summer in some of the coastal districts, this has resulted in growing another type of tourism called “the Cross-Border Tourism” popular where day trips and shopping are usually the main activities.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Congress and Fair Tourism</em></h3>
        <p>
            The most important advantage of İzmir is that its geographical location and climate are very favorable for congress tourism. Congress organizers also prefer cities with suitable weather conditions when planning for the location of the event. The temperate climate of İzmir has a positive effect on congress tourism.

            The ease of transportation to İzmir and the variety of transportation opportunities, the presence of road, airline, sea, and rail connections, as well as the presence of a metro network in urban transportation, are important for congress tourism.

            The historical and cultural values of a city also influence the demand for congress tourism. After the organization, participants can visit the archeological sites of the city in their free time and take advantage of the opportunities provided with cultural tours. Diversity in tourism activities makes way for the development of congress tourism. The places that congress delegates are most interested in and around İzmir are Ephesus, Bergama (Pergamon), the House of the Virgin Mary, and the Agora ruins in the city center.  The city's infrastructure, historical sites, recreation areas as well as superstructure significantly affect the development of congress tourism. Important superstructure investments for congress tourism include congress centers, congress halls, and hotels with congress-centers.

            Meeting rooms are available under the roof of many accommodation establishments in İzmir. In addition, various business and culture-art centers also have meeting rooms on site.

            Swiss Hotel, Kaya Izmir & Convention Hotel, Çeşme Altınyunus Hotel, Çeşme Sheraton Hotel, Wyndham Grand Izmir Özdilek, Richmond Ephesus Hotel, Özdere Paloma Pasha Hotels are accommodation facilities suited for congress tourism.

            Congress tourism should be developed by taking into account the geographical and climatic features and tourist values of Izmir. Congress tourism is very important for İzmir because of its season extending and tourism revenue increasing features.
